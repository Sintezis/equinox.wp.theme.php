         <h3>Internet of Things</h3>
          <p>A company in charge of maintaining a park places IoT sensors whose data about air quality is visible in AR in the form of 3D lights and gauges. </p>
          <h3>Navigation</h3>
        <p>A concert organiser uses public layers to publish performers and stage locations, virtual sign posts at important crossroads pointing to the venue. Objects can also be virtual shops for buying merchandise or providing additional event information. </p>

        <p>A 3D artist creates a large virtual 3D sculpture and pins it at his neighbourhood park; he attaches a smart contract to it so people passing by can tip him for his art. </p>
        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p>A team of LARP players create a private layer with virtual medieval buildings, checkpoints, objects of interest in their game. Smart contract code attached to the objects makes them interactive and a live part of the game. </p>

          <p>A tourist posts a photo of himself jumping off a cliff into the sea and pins it at the geographical location of the path leading to the cliff, so his friends can see it when they walk by. </p>
